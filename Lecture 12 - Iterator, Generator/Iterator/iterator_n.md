# Python Iterators

## Iterable vs Iterator in Python

### Iterable
* An object that can be iterated over using a `for` loop.
* Examples: lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, sets.
* Has an `__iter__()` method that returns an iterator.

### Iterator
* An object that represents a stream of data.
* Has a `__next__()` method that returns the next item in the stream.
* Raises a `StopIteration` exception when there are no more items.
* Created from an iterable using the `iter()` function.

### Key Differences
* Every iterator is an iterable, but not every iterable is an iterator.
* Iterables are used for multiple iterations, while iterators are for single-pass iterations.
* Iterables create a new iterator each time they are iterated over, while iterators maintain their state.

### Example
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # Iterable

# Create an iterator from the list
my_iterator = iter(my_list)

# Iterate using the iterator
print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 1
print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 2
print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 3

# Trying to get the next item after the end raises StopIteration
# print(next(my_iterator))  # Raises StopIteration
```

## Why Use Iterators?
* **Memory efficiency:** Iterators process data one item at a time, reducing memory usage.
* **Lazy evaluation:** Iterators can generate values on demand, improving performance.
* **Infinite sequences:** Iterators can represent infinite sequences, which are not possible with traditional data structures.

**In essence, iterables provide the capability to iterate, while iterators are the mechanisms that actually perform the iteration.**
