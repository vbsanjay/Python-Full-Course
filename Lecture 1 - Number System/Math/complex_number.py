# Define two complex numbers
complex_num1 = 2 + 3j
complex_num2 = 1 - 4j

# Perform operations
addition = complex_num1 + complex_num2
subtraction = complex_num1 - complex_num2
multiplication = complex_num1 * complex_num2
division = complex_num1 / complex_num2

# Print results

print("\nAddition:", addition)
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
